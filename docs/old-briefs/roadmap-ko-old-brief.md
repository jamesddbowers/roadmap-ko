### **Project Brief: RoadmapKO**

#### **Executive Summary**
RoadmapKO is an AI-native, opinionated SaaS platform designed to master the "front-half" of the software development lifecycle, guiding teams from a raw idea to a perfectly aligned, developer-ready backlog. It solves the chronic misalignment between business goals and engineering execution by embedding a proven methodological framework (inspired by BMad and BVSSH principles) directly into the workflow. Its target market is modern software teams and organizations seeking to improve their product management competency. The key value proposition is that RoadmapKO is not just a tool, but a complete system for achieving high-performance, outcome-driven development, positioning it as a powerful, complementary partner and future competitor to execution-focused tools like Linear.

#### **Problem Statement**
In today's high-velocity technology landscape, a chronic and costly disconnect exists between high-level business strategy and the day-to-day work of software development teams. This misalignment manifests in several critical pain points:
* **Inefficient Translation:** Business needs are poorly translated into actionable engineering tasks, leading to the development of features that miss the mark.
* **Unhealthy Backlogs:** Critical issues and tech debt are often deferred indefinitely, causing ongoing quality problems and a poor user experience.
* **Inconsistent Competency:** The quality of product planning varies wildly depending on the skill of the individual product manager, leading to unpredictable outcomes.
The impact of this problem is significant, resulting in wasted R&D spending, delayed time-to-market, low team morale, and a failure to deliver on business objectives. Existing solutions fall short: **Jira** is too complex, and **Linear** excels at execution but does not solve the foundational strategic planning problem.

#### **Proposed Solution**
RoadmapKO is an AI-native SaaS platform that provides a highly opinionated, guided workflow for the "front-half" of the software development lifecycle. The core concept is to provide a complete, embedded methodology that masters the journey from a raw business idea to a fully aligned, developer-ready backlog.
The solution's key differentiators are:
* **An Embedded Methodology:** It provides a complete, outcome-driven system based on BVSSH principles.
* **AI as a Core Partner:** AI is used to translate needs, identify risks, and amplify team competency.
* **Focus on Pre-Development Alignment:** It succeeds by solving dependency and alignment issues *before* they become costly engineering problems.
The high-level vision is to establish RoadmapKO as the essential "Phase Zero" for all high-performance software teams, with a long-term goal of evolving into a fully autonomous, end-to-end platform.

#### **Target Users**
* **Primary: Modern Software Teams & Their Leaders:** PMs, EMs, and leads at high-velocity startups who are frustrated by legacy tools and value speed and efficiency.
* **Secondary: Business Stakeholders & Orgs with Weak PM Competency:** C-suite and VPs who need predictability and a clear view of ROI from their tech investments.
* **Tertiary: Developers & Engineers:** The individual contributors who are directly impacted by poor planning and seek clarity, stability, and a connection between their work and its purpose.

#### **Goals & Success Metrics**
* **Business Objectives:** Launch the MVP and acquire the first 100 paying users within 3 months of launch.
* **User Success Metrics:** Reduce time spent on planning and dependency alignment by 50% for beta users.
* **KPIs:** Achieve a 5% conversion rate from free trial to paid subscription.

#### **MVP Scope (Revised - Agent-First Approach)**
* **Core Features (In Scope - Phase 1-7):**
  - AI-powered multi-agent workflow (Analyst, PM, UX, Architect, QA, PO)
  - Guided planning from idea → project brief → PRD → architecture → user stories
  - Chat interface for conversational AI interaction
  - Document generation and storage (project briefs, PRDs, architecture docs, QA plans)
  - Hierarchical view of planning artifacts
  - Workflow navigator for phase switching and cascading edits
* **Deferred to Phase 8+:**
  - Advanced UI (collapsible panels, detail cards, keyboard shortcuts, canvas visualization)
  - Execution features (Triage Inbox, Cycles, Git Integration)
  - Analytics & Collaboration (Core Analytics dashboard, Slack Integration)
  - Pillar 3 (Full DevOps & Observability automation)

#### **Post-MVP Vision**
* **Phase 2 (Fast Follow):** Introduce a fully interactive 'Living Roadmap' with drill-down modals and an advanced analytics dashboard.
* **Long-term Vision:** Evolve into a highly autonomous platform by building out Pillar 3, the "Performance-to-ROI Mapping" feature, and the "Intelligent Defect Prevention" system.
* **Expansion Opportunities:** After mastering the "front-half," expand to compete directly with Linear on execution, and position for a potential strategic acquisition.

#### **Technical Considerations**
* **Platforms:** Responsive web application with a sub-100ms interaction standard.
* **Technology Preferences:** Next.js, React Flow, Firebase (with GenKit), Weaviate, Stripe, Resend, TipTap, and models from Google, Anthropic, & OpenAI.
* **Architecture:** A serverless monorepo approach is recommended.

#### **Constraints & Assumptions**
* **Constraints:** Limited budget, aggressive timeline, and a single founder driving development.
* **Assumptions:** The BMad method can be successfully productized, current AI agents are mature enough for the development task, and a significant market exists for a highly opinionated tool.

#### **Risks & Open Questions**
* **Risks:** Market adoption of an opinionated tool, execution risk tied to a single founder, and a competitive pivot by Linear.
* **Open Questions:** Optimal pricing strategy, best user acquisition channels, and legal implications of productizing the BMad method.

#### **Appendices**
* **A. Research Summary:** This brief is supported by an in-depth competitive analysis of Linear, Jira, Azure Boards, and Trello, with a particular focus on the strategic playbook of Linear.
